# Critical 

This writing is an attempt to create an objective system of assessing oneself.

This troubles me. 

    * This is subjective
    * It’s overly idealistic, yet a goal to achieve
    * be more strict on self, but be lenient to others
    * Established success
        * One’s subjective vision of success (variation of Maslow’s hierarchy)
        * How sure it he toward this path
        * Measuring each type of success (health, social, ability to provide, philosophy_
